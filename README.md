# Public API

This repository is a static API for my projects. Everything here is public, as the name **public-api** suggests.

This repo serves as a storage space for static APIs, scraped data used in my projects, and files that aren't readily available elsewhere. It acts as a centralized resource for hosting structured data, preprocessed datasets, and reference materials that support various applications. Some of the data here comes from APIs that do not provide direct or persistent access, so it is archived for consistency and reliability. Additionally, it may include assets, configuration files, or metadata required for integration with other systems. Since the information here is meant to remain static, it does not update dynamically but serves as a reliable source for projects that depend on stable datasets and resources.
