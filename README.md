# Public API

This repository is used as a static API for my other projects. Everything here is meant to be public, hence the name **public-api**.

It is primarily used for APIs that are not dynamic or for API scrapes where the scraped data is used by some of my projects. Additionally, it may contain files that aren't readily available outside of my repositories but are necessary for certain applications.
